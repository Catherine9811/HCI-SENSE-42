# SENSE-42: A multimodal dataset from a Simulated Environment for Neurocognitive State Evaluation during Human-Computer Interaction

This repository contains the [source code of the experiment](https://github.com/Catherine9811/SENSE-42-HCI/tree/experiment) implemented by [PsychoPy v2024.2.3](https://www.psychopy.org/), as well as the [Python and R scripts](https://github.com/Catherine9811/SENSE-42-HCI/tree/master) to parse and analyze the SENSE-42-HCI dataset.

The dataset is publicly available on [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/SENSE_42_HCI): https://www.synapse.org/SENSE_42_HCI

## Dataset Description

The SENSE-42-HCI dataset includes multimodal data captured in a 2-hour session for 42 participants, including
- Behavioural Data
- 32-channel Electroencephalogram Recordings with BioSemi ActiveTwo System
- Respiratory Cycles with Respiration Belt
- 3-lead Electrocardiogram Recordings*
- Webcam Recordings*

[*] published data modality is limited to participants consented for sharing them to the public

> ðŸ’¡ After downloaded the [SENSE-42-HCI Dataset](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68714673), we expect them to be organized in the format listed above.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ installed
- pip available
- RStudio installed (to run R scripts)

### Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Catherine9811/SENSE-42-HCI.git
cd SENSE-42-HCI
```

### Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> ðŸ’¡ The `numpy` package version must match the `PsychoPy` package versions. In my case, numpy==1.26.4 and psychopy==2024.2.3

### Run a quick test
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Accessing the Dataset

The dataset is hosted on [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/SENSE_42_HCI): https://www.synapse.org/SENSE_42_HCI

Data from sensors with different modalities are flattened to allow for separete downloads if not all of them are required in the analysis.

> ðŸ’¡ You must login and agree to the conditions for use before accessing the webcam recordings as it contains sensitive information.

## Data Preprocessing
### 3-lead Electrocardiogram Recordings
![ECG Electrodes Placement Information](https://github.com/Catherine9811/SENSE-42-HCI/blob/master/assets/ECG_placement_convention.jpg)

ECG signals are embedded in the external channels of the RAW EEG recording files and the electrode placement conventions is shown in the image above.


### Respiratory Cycles

Respiratory cycles are recorded in the `Resp` channel of the RAW EEG recording files.

We used [RespInPeace](https://github.com/mwlodarczak/RespInPeace) to process and analyze breathing belt data and saved them as `.wav` files in 32 Hz.

![Detected Keypoints from RespInPeace for P001](https://github.com/Catherine9811/SENSE-42-HCI/blob/master/assets/RespInPeace_output.png)

### 32-channel Electroencephalogram Recordings

It is recommended by BioSemi to apply `average` on all the electrodes before other processing steps to enhance the effective signal-to-noise ratio.
